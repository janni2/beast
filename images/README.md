# SCSS Cursors

Cursor icons used by [Beast](https://github.com/tim-janik/beast).

The cursors are layed out at 32x32 pixels, but can be scaled up to 64x64 if that
becomes neccessary in the future.

* eraser.svg: Cursor icon to indicate event removal, license MPL-2.0.
* build.sh: build hotspot PNG files, render SCSS files and create artifact tarball.

The build is slightly involved, using Inkscape and ImageMagick, so prebuilt artifacts
are uploaded and can be fetched from https://github.com/tim-janik/assets/releases/.
