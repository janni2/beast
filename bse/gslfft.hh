 * @param n_values      Number of complex values
 * @param ri_values_in  Complex sample values [0..n_values*2-1]
 * @param ri_values_out Complex frequency values [0..n_values*2-1]
 *
 * This function performs a decimation in time fourier transformation
 * in forward direction, where the input values are equidistant sampled
 * data, and the output values contain the frequency proportions of the
 * input.
 * The input and output arrays are complex values with real and imaginery
 * portions interleaved, adressable in the range [0..2*n_values-1], where
 * n_values must be a power of two.
 * Frequencies are stored in-order, the K-th output corresponds to the
 * frequency K/n_values. (If you want to interpret negative frequencies,
 * note that the frequencies -K/n_values and (n_values-K)/n_values are
 * equivalent).
 *
 * In general for the gsl_power2_fft*() family of functions, normalization is
 * only performed during backward transform if the gsl_power2_fftsc_scale()
 * is used. No normalization is performed if gsl_power2_fftsc() is used.
 *
 * However, a popular mathematical strategy of defining the FFT and IFFT in a
 * way that the formulas are symmetric is normalizing both, the forward and
 * backward transform with 1/sqrt(N) - where N is the number of complex values
 * (n_values).
 *
 * Compared to the above definition, in this implementation, the analyzed
 * values produced by gsl_power2_fftac()/gsl_power2_fftar() will be too large
 * by a factor of sqrt(N), which however are cancelled out on the backward
 * transform (for _scale variants).
 *
 * Note that the transformation is performed out of place, the input
 * array is not modified, and may not overlap with the output array.
